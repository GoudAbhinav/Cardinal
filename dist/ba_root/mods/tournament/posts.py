"""posts for the brackets and announcements channels, held for the owners to review.

instead of going public at once, a post is stored in a queue, the discord bot shows it to the staff
channel (tagging the owners) and publishes it `hold_hours` later. the owners can send it earlier or
cancel it with buttons. if a newer version of the same post (same key, like a bracket that changed
after a match) comes in while it is still held, it replaces the held one.

this is used by the image generator (its own process) and by the bot, so every change to the queue
is made under a file lock.
